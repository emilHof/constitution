## Article VIII - Hazing 

Unix Users Group, in keeping with JMU's expectations for a positive academic
and social environment, unconditionally opposes hazing. No individual member of
our group or the group itself may engage in or plan any activity that may be
defined as hazing.

Unix Users Group opposes any situation created intentionally to produce mental
or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule to its members
or potential members. In addition, no individual nor recognized organization
may by physical or mental stress or by subtle or covert technique, impair, make
captive, or destroy an individuals' freedom of thought and choice.

J17-100 Hazing - The university prohibits any situation created intentionally
to produce mental or physical discomfort, embarrassment, harassment or ridicule
in connection with or the purpose of initiation, admission into, or affiliation
with or as a condition for continued membership in a club, organization, or
association, regardless of whether the students participated voluntarily in the
relevant activity. Students directing, engaging in, aiding, or participating
in, actively or passively, the forcing, compelling, requiring, encouraging,
expecting, whether direct or implied, of individuals to participate in hazing
activities shall be considered in violation of this policy.

It is impossible to anticipate every situation that could involve hazing.
Behavior listed below does not, and cannot encompass every circumstance that
can be categorized as hazing. Further, this policy is not intended to prohibit
customary athletic events, contests, and competitions that are sponsored by the
institution or the organized and supervised practices associated with such
events or activity or conduct that furthers the goals of a legitimate
educational curriculum, extracurricular program, or military training program
as approved by the University.

Hazing activities include but are not limited to; physical abuse; kidnapping,
blindfolding, confinement, or binding and/or restricting movement; calisthenics
or other strenuous physical activity used to harass, punish, or harm an
individual; excursions; spraying, painting, or pelting with any substance;
burying in any substance; nudity; servitude; exposure to uncomfortable elements;
verbal abuse or harassment; wearing of apparel which is conspicuous or indecent;
forcing consumption of any legal or illegal substance (e.g. food, liquid,
beverage, alcohol, drug, or other substance); depriving of sufficient sleep;
burning, branding, or tattooing; interrogation in an intimidating or threatening
manner; misleading members in an effort to convince them that they will not
become or remain members unless they complete tasks, follow instructions, or act
in a certain way; misleading members into believing that they will be hurt
during induction or initiation; carrying items that serve no constructive
purpose or that are designed to punish or embarrass the carrier; requiring or
suggesting obtaining, possessing items or completing tasks in an unlawful manner
(i.e. scavenger hunts); any act that is designed to or likely to compromise the
dignity of a member or prospective member, cause embarrassment or shame to a
member or prospective member, cause a member or prospective member to be the
object of malicious amusement, ridicule, or emotional strain, or cause
psychological harm or substantial emotional strain; or any other activity which
may result in physical injury or endanger the health or life of the individual
being hazed.

An individual cannot consent to being hazed; a victim’s voluntary or willfulr
participation in hazing activities will not be considered evidence that a
violation of this policy did not occur. Section 18.2-56 of the Code of Virginia
declares hazing illegal, establishes conditions for civil and criminal
liability, and outlines the duties of the university when a student has been
found guilty of hazing in civil or criminal court.

It is hereby incorporated as part of this constitution and will serve as a guide
for action by the university and the Unix Users Group if there is an instance
of hazing by this organization or any of the members of this organization.  It
will be the duty of the officers of the Unix Users Group to educate the
membership of this policy.

## Article IX - Amendments

Amendments to this constitution must be submitted in writing at a regular
meeting of the organization. Said amendment(s) will be voted on at a subsequent
meeting. In order to adopt the amendment, a vote of 2/3 of the general
membership is necessary.
 
## Article X - Ratification

This constitution shall become effective upon approval by a ¾ vote of the
membership. Ratified constitutions must be submitted to the Student Activities
& Involvement office within 10 days for final approval.
